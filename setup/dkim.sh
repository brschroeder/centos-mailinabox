# OpenDKIM provides a service that puts a DKIM signature on outbound mail.
#
# The DNS configuration for DKIM is done in the management daemon.

# The file /etc/opendkim.conf already exists and is prepopulated with most options
# commented out. If we find ExternalIgnoreList at start of line, we assume the file has
# already been configured (default is for this line to start  with "#")

# Create a new DKIM key. This creates mail.private and mail.txt
# in "$STORAGE_ROOT"/mail/dkim. The former is the private key and
# the latter is the suggested DNS TXT entry which we'll include
# in our DNS setup. Note that the files are named after the
# 'selector' of the key, which we can change later on to support
# key rotation.
#
# A 1024-bit key is seen as a minimum standard by several providers
# such as Google. But they and others use a 2048 bit key, so we'll
# do the same. Keys beyond 2048 bits may exceed DNS record limits.

# Add OpenDKIM and OpenDMARC as milters to postfix, which is how OpenDKIM
# intercepts outgoing mail to perform the signing (by adding a mail header)
# and how they both intercept incoming mail to add Authentication-Results
# headers. The order possibly/probably matters: OpenDMARC relies on the
# OpenDKIM Authentication-Results header already being present.
#
# Be careful. If we add other milters later, this needs to be concatenated
# on the smtpd_milters line.
#
# The OpenDMARC milter is skipped in the SMTP submission listener by
# configuring smtpd_milters there to only list the OpenDKIM milter
# (see mail-postfix.sh).
