# Basic System Configuration
# -------------------------

# ### Set hostname of the box

# If the hostname is not correctly resolvable sudo can't be used. This will result in
# errors during the install
#
# First set the hostname in the configuration file, then activate the setting

hostnamectl set-hostname $PRIMARY_HOSTNAME

# ### Add swap space to the system

# If the physical memory of the system is below 2GB it is wise to create a
# swap file. This will make the system more resiliant to memory spikes and
# prevent for instance spam filtering from crashing

# We will create a 1G file, this should be a good balance between disk usage
# and buffers for the system. We will only allocate this file if there is more
# than 5GB of disk space available

# The following checks are performed:
# - Check if swap is currently mountend by looking at /proc/swaps
# - Check if the user intents to activate swap on next boot by checking fstab entries.
# - Check if a swapfile already exists
# - Check if the root file system is not btrfs, might be an incompatible version with
#   swapfiles. User should hanle it them selves.
# - Check the memory requirements
# - Check available diskspace

# See https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-14-04
# for reference

# ### Update Packages

# Update system packages to make sure we have the latest upstream versions
# from CentOS

echo Updating system packages...
hide_output yum --assumeyes --quiet update

# ### Install System Packages

# Install basic utilities.
#
# * haveged: Provides extra entropy to /dev/random so it doesn't stall
#	         when generating random numbers for private keys (e.g. during
#	         ldns-keygen).
# * unattended-upgrades: Apt tool to install security updates automatically.
#         yum-cron offers similar functionality
# * cron: Runs background processes periodically.
# * ntp: keeps the system time correct
# * fail2ban: scans log files for repeated failed login attempts and blocks the remote IP at the firewall
# * git: we install some things directly from github
# * bc: allows us to do math to compute sane defaults

echo Installing support packages...
hide_output yum --assumeyes --quiet install wget curl git bc unzip \
	cronie yum-cron ntp

# ### Set the system timezone
#
# Some systems are missing /etc/localtime, which we cat into the configs for
# Z-Push and ownCloud, so we need to set it to something. Daily cron tasks
# like the system backup are run at a time tied to the system timezone, so
# letting the user choose will help us identify the right time to do those
# things (i.e. late at night in whatever timezone the user actually lives
# in).
#
# However, changing the timezone once it is set seems to confuse fail2ban
# and requires restarting fail2ban (done below in the fail2ban
# section) and syslog (see #328). There might be other issues, and it's
# not likely the user will want to change this, so we only ask on first
# setup.

if [ -z "${NONINTERACTIVE:-}" ]; then
	if [ ! -f /etc/localtime ] || [ ! -z ${FIRST_TIME_SETUP:-} ]; then
		# If the file is missing or this is the user's first time running
		# Mail-in-a-Box setup, run the interactive timezone configuration
		# tool.
		NEW_TZ=$(tzselect)
		timedatectl set-timezone $NEW_TZ
		restart_service rsyslog
	fi

	# This is a non-interactive setup so we can't ask the user.
