# Basic System Configuration
# -------------------------

# ### Set hostname of the box

# If the hostname is not correctly resolvable sudo can't be used. This will result in
# errors during the install
#
# First set the hostname in the configuration file, then activate the setting

hostnamectl set-hostname $PRIMARY_HOSTNAME

# ### Add swap space to the system

# If the physical memory of the system is below 2GB it is wise to create a
# swap file. This will make the system more resiliant to memory spikes and
# prevent for instance spam filtering from crashing

# We will create a 1G file, this should be a good balance between disk usage
# and buffers for the system. We will only allocate this file if there is more
# than 5GB of disk space available

# The following checks are performed:
# - Check if swap is currently mountend by looking at /proc/swaps
# - Check if the user intents to activate swap on next boot by checking fstab entries.
# - Check if a swapfile already exists
# - Check if the root file system is not btrfs, might be an incompatible version with
#   swapfiles. User should hanle it them selves.
# - Check the memory requirements
# - Check available diskspace

# See https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-14-04
# for reference

# ### Update Packages

# Update system packages to make sure we have the latest versions

echo Updating system packages...
# hide_output yum --assumeyes --quiet update <-- TEMPORARILY DISABLED TO TEST AUTOMATIC UPDATES

# ### Install System Packages

# Install basic utilities
#
# git: we install some things directly from github
# curl: we need to download some files
# bc: allows us to do math to compute sane defaults
# cronie: cron daemon to run background process periodically
# chrony: network time protocol client
# dnf-automatic: automatic updates, both download and install

echo Installing support packages...
# Install applications
hide_output yum --assumeyes --quiet install wget curl git bc unzip
# Install services/daemons that run continuously
hide_output yum --assumeyes --quiet install cronie chrony dnf-automatic
restart_service crond
restart_service chronyd
# enable automatic downloads and installation of updates
sed -i 's/apply_updates = no/apply_updates = yes/' /etc/dnf/automatic.conf
hide_output systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic.timer

# ************ REMOVE UPON RELEASE ************************************************
# Install some tools needed to process SELinux alerts
hide_output yum --assumeyes --quiet install setools setools-console setroubleshoot
# *********************************************************************************

# ### Set the system timezone
#
# Some systems are missing /etc/localtime, which we cat into the configs for
# Z-Push and ownCloud, so we need to set it to something. Daily cron tasks
# like the system backup are run at a time tied to the system timezone, so
# letting the user choose will help us identify the right time to do those
# things (i.e. late at night in whatever timezone the user actually lives
# in).
#
# However, changing the timezone once it is set seems to confuse
# syslog (see #328). There might be other issues, and it's
# not likely the user will want to change this, so we only ask on first
# setup.

		# tool.

# ### Firewall

# Explicity turn on and enable firewall

# By default the port for cockpit (TCP 9090) is open, close it
